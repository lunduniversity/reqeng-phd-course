## Planning meeting 2024-02-36

TODO: Before the meeting:
* prepare the meeting by talking to your supervisor about the proposal below.

### Proposed parts:

1. **Seminars.** A number of seminars during LTH's study-period nbr 4 (mid March - end of May) where I give an overview of different subtopics of the RE discipline combined with prepared discussions based on a common literature list including a bunch of academic papers and this practical book: Soren Lauesen, Software Requirements - Styles and Techniques, AddisonWesley, ISBN 0-201-74570-4, 2002.  So you are expected to read a some chapters in the book plus a couple of papers before each seminar. Seminar topics:
  * Introduction: terminology & process
  * Context
    * Agile RE
    * Open Source RE
    * Market-oriented RE
    * Ethics
  * Elicitation: interviews
  * Specification & Modelling
    * Abstraction and level of details
    * Functional requirements: data & logic
    * Quality requirements
      * security and safety; critical systems/high-assurance systems
    * Constraints
    * Regulatory requirements: GDPR & AI Act (RE for AI)
    * Tools for RE, AI for RE
  * Selection 
    * Prioritization 
    * Release Planning
  * Validation:
    * quality aspects
    * inspection
    * checklists
    * reducing ambiguity
  * Prototyping & Usability testing

2. **Lab** One of the seminars will be devoted to a longer practical lab with the reqT tool based on two 2h labs given for undergraduates in this course: https://cs.lth.se/krav/  I guess that if I help you prepare you can carry out those in one session of around 3 hrs. My plan is to update the labs based on input from this year's teaching and let you test the new version of the labs.

3. **Further Readings.** A literature search and creating individual literature list with specific RE papers relevant to each participant's research.

4. **Report.** An individual report on a selected RE topic/problem relevant to each participant's research. 

5. **Peer-review and Presentation** among participants of each others' report from 3.

### Discussion at meeting

1. How many credit points should it be? My idea is that parts 1+2+3 equals 3 credits and parts 3+4 equals 2 credits making a total of 7.5 ECTS credits  (where 1.5 ECTS credits a.k.a högskolepoäng (hp) corresponds to approx one week of full-time studies)

2.  When do you want the seminars to start? After March 19
3.  Avoid these dates for seminars:
  - Easter: March 28 -> April 1 
  - April 9-12  
  - April 15-19  
  - April 24-26 
  - June 11-12  

You can start reading as soon as you want but I'd like to start the seminars in late March or early April. The individual part 3 + peer review part 4 can be examined e.g. mid august.  I have no other teaching in study period 4 so I'd like to concentrate my work there.

4. Do you like the common+individual scheme as outlined above? How can we make the individual part as valuable as possible for your own research?

5. Any other ideas?
