# Seminar 1: Context, Elicitation, Prioritization

## Preparations

1. Read this before the seminar: 
* Lauesen Chapter 1. Introduction, Chapter 8. Elicitation
* PRIO: Berander, Patrik, and Anneliese Andrews. "Requirements prioritization." Engineering and managing software requirements. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2005. 69-94. ISBN 3-540-25043-3, 2005.
* MDRE: Regnell, Björn, and Sjaak Brinkkemper. "Market-driven requirements engineering for software products." Engineering and managing software requirements. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, ISBN 3-540-25043- 32005. pp. 287-308.

2. Prepare 4 discussion items. 
  * The 4 discussion items that you prepare can be anything that you want to raise at the seminar, e.g. something unclear, something related other things you have read or know about, a question to me about how this can be interpreted, critique of the text, etc. It is not a big deal, but more a way for us to have an interesting intellectual discussion.

## Agenda

* Time plan: 13:15-17; leg stretcher around 14, 16; longer break around 15.

* Goal, requirements and design of this course. (Why-What-How)
  * Goals:
    * Learn RE terminology in-depth
    * Acquire practical RE skills
    * Get acquainted with the RE research front
    * Connect your RE learning with your PhD Thesis project
  * Requirements (examination): 7.5p
    * Prepare seminars
    * Actively engage in seminar discussions
    * Define and conduct an individual project 
    * Provide input to MSc course development 
    * Provide feedback to MSc RE project students (Jonathan + Axel)
    * Define and conduct an RE project
  * Design
    * Reading list (see plan)
    * 5 seminars every other week March 19 - May  (see plan)
    * Individual literature search -> reading list -> report
    * Project + presentation + optional report (conducted individual or in pairs, examined by supervisor)

* Context: Bring up discussion while we browse the [slides](https://github.com/lunduniversity/reqeng-phd-course/blob/main/2024/seminar1-slides.pdf) 
  * Consider:
     1. Understanding/interpretation of terminology, unclear things
     2. Connection to your research interests
     3. What would you like to read more about? 

* Around 14:40. Discussion on connection with EDAN70.

* Around 14:50. Break until 15:15.

* At 15:15-15:30. MSc Students in EDAN70 visit to present their project ideas. 

  * Discussion on win-win around PhD students interests

* Around 15:40: Elicitation: continue browsing slides and discuss.

* Around 16:15 Prioritization: continue browsing slides and discuss.

* At 16:45 lates: Discuss plan for Seminar 2. Preparation:
  1. Read Lauesen Chapters on specification of Functional Requirements (FR): 2 (Data), 3 & 4 (Logic), 5 (Special Interfaces). Read iteratively, first iteration: grey boxes
