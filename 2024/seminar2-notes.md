## Preparations

### Read this before the seminar: 

  * Lauesen Chapter 2. , 3., 4. , 5.

### Prepare 4 discussion items. 

  * The 4 discussion items that you prepare can be anything that you want to raise at the seminar, e.g. something unclear, something related other things you have read or know about, a question to me about how this can be interpreted, critique of the text, etc. It is not a big deal, but more a way for us to have an interesting intellectual discussion.
