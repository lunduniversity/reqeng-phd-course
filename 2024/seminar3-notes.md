# Seminar 3: Functionality, Prototyping, Delegated requirements

## Preparations

### Read this before the seminar: 

* Lauesen chapters:  
  *  6: Quality Requirements
  *  7: Requirements in the product life cycle
  *  9: Checking and validation
  * 10: Techniques at work

* QUPER: Regnell, Björn, Richard Berntsson Svensson, and Thomas Olsson. "Supporting roadmapping of quality requirements." IEEE software 25.2 (2008). doi: 10.1109/MS.2008.48

* RP: Ruhe, Gunther, and Moshood Omolade Saliu. "The art and science of software release planning." IEEE software 22.6 (2005): 47-53.  doi: 10.1109/MS.2005.164

### Prepare 4 discussion items. 

  * The 4 discussion items that you prepare can be anything that you want to raise at the seminar, e.g. something unclear, something related other things you have read or know about, a question to me about how this can be interpreted, critique of the text, etc. It is not a big deal, but more a way for us to have an interesting intellectual discussion.

## Agenda

* Time plan: 13:15-17; leg stretcher around 14, 16; longer break around 15.

  * Round-robin with one discussion item each.

  * Discuss [slides](https://github.com/lunduniversity/reqeng-phd-course/blob/main/2024/seminar3-slides.pdf) while bringing up more discussion items.

  * Here is the greedy release planning example:

  * Here is the talk on QUPER from Öredev:

## Preparations for next seminar 

Seminar 4: Special Domains and Contexts

* Prepare discussion items on these papers:
  * AGRE: Cao, Lan, and Balasubramaniam Ramesh. "Agile requirements engineering practices: An empirical study." IEEE software 25.1, pp. 60-67, 2008. doi: 10.1109/MS.2008.1

  * OSSRE: Scacchi is the first paper on OSSRE (ever?) but probably a bit outdated. The Linåker paper focuses on strategies of organisations in relation to OSSRE.
    * Scacchi, Walt. "Understanding requirements for open source software." Design requirements engineering: A ten-year perspective. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2009. 467-494. 
    * [Linåker, Regnell. "What to share, when, and where: balancing the objectives and complexities of open source software contributions"](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09855-2.pdf) 

* RE4AI: Each participant selects one paper that you want to read that no other participant reads and get ok on the paper from Bjorn via email. Starting-point for your search of an interesting paper:
[Sadovski, Aviv, Hadar. "Towards a Comprehensive Ontology for Requirements Engineering for AI-powered Systems" Refsq 2024.](https://coursegit.cs.lth.se/bjorn.regnell/reqeng-phd-course-project/-/tree/main/papers?ref_type=heads)
  * Summarize it during the seminar on max 5 min.

* *Regulatory requirements:* Taka a look at each of these two EU regulations, GDPR and AI Act, and for each of them: propose concrete examples of one **data** requirements, one **business logic** requirement and one **quality** requirements implied by these legislations. Choose a concrete hypothetical or real app or domain for which your proposed requirements are relevant.

  * GDPR: 
    * https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en 

  * AI Act: 
    * The final version that was voted on by the EU parliament March 2024:
https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0138_EN.pdf
    * Some relevant articles in the AI Act to focus on: 
      * High-risk AI requirements: Articles 9–15, 17, 72
      * Transparency obligations (mostly relevant for generative AI): Article 50
      * General purpose AI requirements (e.g. for ChatGPT): Articles 53, 55
    * All AI Act documents (a huge mass...): 
      * https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/excellence-and-trust-artificial-intelligence_en#documents


* SMIRK: Take a look here and try to formulate what is special with this domain from a requirements engineering perspective that you are interested in: https://github.com/RI-SE/smirk/tree/main/docs
